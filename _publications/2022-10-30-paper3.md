In this paper, we mathematically modelled the multiplexing coding problem and made use of Sperner's theorem to derive a new coding method named combinatorial coding strategy which is able to achieve the theoretical maximum coding capacity. We then proposed and named a novel MUX design: CoMUX. for its usage of combinatorial coding. An efficient algorithm was also proposed to synthesize CoMUX designs. In the end, we proposed defect simulation tools to test reliabilites of different MUX designs, and proved CoMUX a much more reliable design than the classic one. In conclusion, the CoMUX is a control-resource-saving, area-saving and robust control MUX design.
