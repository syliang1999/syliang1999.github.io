title: "Multi-Layer Package Power/Ground Planes Synthesis with Balanced DC IR Drops: A Game-Theoretic Optimization Approach"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'As one of the earliest works focusing on the design automation of power/ground plane in packages, this paper introduces a game-theoretic optimization method aimed at evenly mitigating DC IR drops across the multi-layer package power/ground planes. Experimental results demonstrate that the maximum DC IR drop and the IR drop difference can both be significantly reduced.'

Recently, the challenge of integrating an increasing number of transistors on a single die to adhere to Mooreâ€™s Law has spurred the need for innovative packaging solutions. 
Power/ground planes are integral to packages, and designers typically strive to maximize their size.
This provides shielding and maintains constant impedance for adjacent high-speed signal wires, benefiting signal integrity.
Additionally, large power/ground planes help reduce DC IR drops, enhancing power integrity.
However, the necessity for multiple power/ground nets, each requiring independent power/ground planes within a package, makes the optimal allocation of limited free space a complex task. 
In this paper, we introduce a game-theoretic optimization method aimed at evenly mitigating DC IR drops across the multi-layer package power/ground planes. 
In the formulated game of achieving the ideal power/ground plane design, we can enhance the use of package space and realize a design with evenly distributed DC IR drops across all power/ground planes. 
This is accomplished by adjusting strategies and reaching a state of Nash equilibrium in the allocation of free space.
Additionally, we propose a rapid multi-layer power/ground plane DC IR drop evaluation and a power/ground plane legalization method to bolster our optimization method.
