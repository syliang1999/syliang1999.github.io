collection: publications
excerpt: 'As one of the earliest works focusing on the design automation of power/ground plane in packages, this paper introduces a game-theoretic optimization method aimed at evenly mitigating DC IR drops across the multi-layer package power/ground planes. Experimental results demonstrate that the maximum DC IR drop and the IR drop difference can both be significantly reduced.'

In this paper, we introduce a game-theoretic optimization method aimed at evenly mitigating DC IR drops across the multi-layer package power/ground planes. 
In the formulated game of achieving the ideal power/ground plane design, we can enhance the use of package space and realize a design with evenly distributed DC IR drops across all power/ground planes. 
This is accomplished by adjusting strategies and reaching a state of Nash equilibrium in the allocation of free space.
Additionally, we propose a rapid multi-layer power/ground plane DC IR drop evaluation and a power/ground plane legalization method to bolster our optimization method.
