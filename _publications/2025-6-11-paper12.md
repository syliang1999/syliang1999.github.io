In this paper, we propose AutoRE, the first tool to automatically enhance reliability by optimizing layouts. AutoRE varies the layout within a certain range without changing its topology, and adopts Bayesian optimization (BO) to identify the most reliable variant. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoRE can efficiently and effectively improve the reliability across all testcases by around 40% on average.
