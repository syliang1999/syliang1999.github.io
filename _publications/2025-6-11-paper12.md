title: "Multi-Layer Package Power/Ground Planes Synthesis with Balanced DC IR Drops: A Game-Theoretic Optimization Approach"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'As one of the earliest works focusing on the design automation of power/ground plane in packages, this paper introduces a game-theoretic optimization method aimed at evenly mitigating DC IR drops across the multi-layer package power/ground planes. Experimental results demonstrate that the maximum DC IR drop and the IR drop difference can both be significantly reduced.'

In this paper, we propose AutoRE, the first tool to automatically enhance reliability by optimizing layouts. AutoRE varies the layout within a certain range without changing its topology, and adopts Bayesian optimization (BO) to identify the most reliable variant. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoRE can efficiently and effectively improve the reliability across all testcases by around 40% on average.
