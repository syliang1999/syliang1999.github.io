In this paper we made use of different DL models, trained them using linear power grid model IEEE-39. Then we performed prediction on both linear and nonlinear power grid model, compared the perfromance of different DL models and chose the best one as the final model. In the end, we deployed the chosen model on a larger power grid model IEEE-118 and the results were also great, which proved the generality of our method.
