This paper proposes a novel gate structure for modifying the current MUX architecture, along with a mixed coding strategy that achieves the maximum coding capacity within the modified MUX architecture. Additionally, an efficient synthesis tool for the mixed-coding-based MUXes (LaMUXes) is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the LaMUX is exceptionally efficient, substantially reducing the usage of pneumatic controllers and microvalves compared to existing MUX designs.
