Interposer-based packaging has emerged as a pivotal technology for integrating advanced logic and memory chiplets in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. 
To accommodate growing system complexity, ultra-large wafer-scale integration employs expanded silicon interposers to support more chiplets. 
However, manufacturing such interposers exceeds the limits of single-mask lithography, requiring mask stitching, a technique that introduces unique physical design constraints and structural discontinuities. 
Additionally, thermo-mechanical stress, particularly near through-silicon vias (TSVs) and stitching regions, poses critical reliability challenges that conventional floorplanning methods fail to address.
This paper presents MMPack, a hierarchical analytical framework for multi-mask chiplet-package co-design. 
Our approach integrates three key innovations:
(1) a performance-driven partitioning algorithm that minimizes inter-chiplet and inter-mask communication overhead; 
(2) a stitching-aware hierarchical floorplanning strategy based on alternating optimization to address mask boundary constraints; and
(3) a stress-aware post-processing step that employs an analytical model to reduce critical stress concentrations while preserving floorplanning quality.
Experimental results demonstrate that MMPack significantly enhances both architectural performance and mechanical reliability while maintaining efficient layout and runtime scalability. 
These results highlight the practicality of our framework for enabling robust, high-performance designs in next-generation wafer-scale integration systems.
