Greetings! ï¼š)

My name is Siyuan Liang and I was born in Xi'an, China in 1999. You can also call me Kyrie if you like.

I joined Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2018, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Automation (Elite class), and was awarded the Academic Elite Scholarship of 180,000 RMB. After 4 years of hard work, I finally got my bacholar's degree and became an honorary graduate of Qian Xuesen's college in 2022. In the same year, I was admitted to The Chinese University of Hong Kong and started my Ph.D career in the department of Computer Science and Engineering.

I am currently a Ph.D student co-supervised by Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho and Prof. Tsun-Ming Tseng (from TUM). My study interests include Electronic Design Automation (EDA), Microfluidics and Machine Learning (ML). I will keep updating news about me and my publications in the corresponding pages. Besides researching, I am also responsible for some TA works, which are shown in the Teaching page. More details about me are shown in the CV page, please check it if you are interested.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me via E-mail, I will try my best to reply timely.

It's really nice to meet you, wish you have a good day!
