Greetings! ：)

My name is Siyuan Liang and I was born in Xi'an, China in 1999. You can also call me Kryie if you like.

I joined in Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2018, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Automation (Elite class), and was awarded the Academic Elite Scholarship of 180,000 RMB. After 4 years of hard work, I finally got my bacholar's degree and became a honorary graduate in 2022. In the same year, I was admitted to The Chinese University of Hong Kong and start my Ph.D career in the department of Computer Science and Engineering.

I am currently a Ph.D student co-supervised by Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho and Prof. Tsun-Ming Tseng (from TUM). My study interests include Electronic Design Automation (EDA), Microfluidic, Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). I will keep updating news about me and my publications in the corresponding pages of my site. Besides researching, I am also responsible for some TA works, which are shown in the Teaching page.
