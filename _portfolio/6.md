In this paper, we propose the combinatorial coding, a novel MUX coding strategy, along with an algorithm to synthesize combinatorial-coding-based MUXes (CoMUXes) of arbitrary sizes with the theoretical maximum coding capacity.
We also develop a simplification method to reduce the number of valves and the total length of control channels in CoMUXes, thereby improving their reliability.
Additionally, we develop a reliability-aware adaptation method to reliably integrate the CoMUXes into the main functional part of the designs.
