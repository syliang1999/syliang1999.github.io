I am really grateful to the committee for this recognition—it is a true honor to receive this award.
The DAC Ph.D. Forum is one of the premier platforms for Ph.D. students in design automation to present their research, receive valuable feedback, and engage with industry leaders on cutting-edge academic work. I thoroughly enjoyed presenting my research on the systematic optimization of reliability and control efficiency for microfluidic biochips.
Attending such conferences has always been a great pleasure. Let’s continue to push boundaries and make amazing happens. Excelsior!
