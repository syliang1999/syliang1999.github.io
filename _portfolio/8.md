Thanks to the hard work of all the co-authors, this work finally gets accepted!
As one of the earliest works in the design automation for package power/ground planes, this work proposes a game-theoretic optimization method aimed at evenly mitigating DC IR drops across the multi-layer package power/ground planes. 
Experimental results show its great performance in synthesizing power/ground planes with much better IR drop performance.
