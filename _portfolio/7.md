First time multi-party cooperation, hard work pays off! 
The LaMUX, which contains a novel and practical logic gate, can address at least 100% more channels comparing to existing microfluidic multiplexer designs.
Looking forward to seeing this powerful multiplexer gets applied in different microfluidic biochips and supports increasingly complex biochemical experimentsÔºÅ
