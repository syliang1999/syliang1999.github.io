Thanks to the hard work of all, the AutoRE paper gets accepted smoothly.
AutoRE utilizes the reliability quantification models proposed in our previous work ARMM (accepted by ICCAD 2023), and presents the first automatic reliability enhancement tool for microfluidic biochips. Looking forward to its helping boosting the marketization of the microfluidic biochip, the next generation biochemical experimental platform.
